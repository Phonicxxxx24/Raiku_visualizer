# Overview
Raiku Visualizer is an interactive web blueprint built for the Inevitable Ideathon (Track 4: Visual Simulations & Blueprints). It visually demonstrates how Raiku brings deterministic execution and guaranteed transaction inclusion to the Solana ecosystem. Through simulations, dashboards, and interactive blueprints, users can explore the necessity and impact of deterministic blockspace in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and AI coordination.
# Features
Dynamic hero section with branded visualsCongestion visualization: transaction failure demo during Solana network spikesDeterministic engine and slot scheduling timelineLive dashboard showing blockspace success rates and instant slot reservationsUse case blueprints: DEX, NFTs, gaming, AI agent coordinationArchitecture diagram for developer integrationWhy It MattersDuring volatile periods on Solana, up to 75% of transactions can fail—leading to lost opportunities and unreliable experiences. Raiku guarantees institutional-grade certainty with cryptographically pre-confirmed execution, and this visualizer makes those guarantees tangible for all stakeholders.
